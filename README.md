In this project, I will be analyzing a real estate data set (Hotsheet) that contains information about property listings in Hawaii from June 10, 2023, to June 10, 2024. I will be conducting data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data vizualization in Microsoft Excel and Python. The goal is to gain a general understanding about the data set and to answer questions.
