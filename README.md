This GitHub repository is to document my work for the NSF ATE Project.

<p>
In this project, I will be analyzing a real estate data set (Hotsheet) that contains information about property listings in Maui from June 10, 2023, to June 10, 2024. I will be doing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data vizualization in Microsoft Excel and Python. The goal is to identity insights, if any, then create a report/presentation about the insights.
